Small administrative command-line utilities

Those are small administrative command-line utilities that accept arguments in the file name as well as from the command line. For example, consider "@InsertTextFiles_MySqlDatabase(s=localhost, u=root, p=, d=worldlists, t=mainspace, f=filename, c=content).exe". 

Also, when files are dropped on a given utility, the utility will work on those files, and if the utility is started normally, it will work on all the files in the directory it is in.

So, you put some of those "stones" into a folder with documents, with names starting with '@' or underscore, for example, so that they are at the top of all other files, and double-click one when you need a particular administrative task to be done with the files in that folder, or drag-drop specific files, while being able to tweak the behaviour of the stones by editing their file name, when needed.

P.S. I will edit this readme with more detailed explanation, when I'm able to.
P.P.S. The repo is named in a pompose manner for humor's sake :)
